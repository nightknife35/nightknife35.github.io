## To-do
- products have visible id in webpage
- products will have a physical paper with their id στην αποθηκη
- fix navbar for mobile (burger from start)
- add contact page
- add the ability to view more than one image per product (arrows besides the image)
- greek n english 
    - toggleable button cuz grandpas. but dropdown for futureproof. idk which one i like most 
    - Also do we pass em a new html or change the existing one (i thing changing)
- add that they are limited availability (good for selling)
- add stacks (2 beeds exactly the same)
- update the products on js to have a object called specs (for type of wood and size and finish etc (it will make it more dynamic))

## Note
- i will be the only one to update the website anyway. So pappou will HAVE to call me every time and tell me "remove id 4". so its ok to have it in json or even in the javascript
- My personal nn website turn into papyrus gallery and basically word of mouth and showing it around to people and if they like they can contact me or him. shipping mainly to arta preveza patra athens (we (me, chris, mom) would be invoices) and we can talk if someone wants from anywhere else. altternatives include:
    - shopify (make your own website + shiping and promotion tools)
    - etsy (amazon for artsy people)
    - fairs (not online, but good)
    - fb marketplace (worse price but prob more convenient (maybe not cuz of chatting and haggle online (bad for pa. unless theio hlia does it)))
